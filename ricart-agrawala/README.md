## ricart-agrawala - RaspberryPi, NodeJS, Websockets and More

This NodeJS app, ricart-agrawala, is a demonstration and implementation of the Ricart-Agrawala Mutual Exclusion Algorithm by those authors. Additional information can be found:

- [WikiPedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricartâ€“Agrawala_algorithm)
- [Distributed Computing: Principles, Algorithms, and Systems](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/engineering/communications-and-signal-processing/distributed-computing-principles-algorithms-and-systems)
- [An Optimal Algorithm for Mutual Exclusion in Computer Networks](http://cs.hbg.psu.edu/comp512.papers/RicartAgrawala-81.pdf)

I've also excerpted the description of the algorithm from the Chapter 9 slides of the *Distributed Computing* textbook above. See [RicartAgrawalaDescription.pdf](RicartAgrawalaDescription.pdf).
